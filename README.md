# Matrix-Calculator
The program uses a MATRIX class to encapsulate the matrix operations and data. The class has member functions for each operation, and it uses a file named "SAVE.txt" to store the results of each operation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

1. Input Matrix: The input() function prompts the user to enter the number of rows and columns for two matrices, and then it reads the matrix elements from the user.

2. Addition Matrix: The additionMatrix() function adds the two input matrices element-wise and stores the result in a file.

3. Subtraction Matrix: The subtractionMatrix() function subtracts the second input matrix from the first input matrix element-wise and stores the result in a file.

4. Multiplication Matrix: The multiplicationMatrix() function multiplies the two input matrices using the standard matrix multiplication algorithm and stores the result in a file.

5. Transpose Matrix: The transposeMatrix() function computes the transpose of each input matrix and stores the results in a file.

The program uses a menu-driven interface to allow the user to choose which operation to perform. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
